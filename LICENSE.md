## GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  
**Version 2, June 1991**

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,  
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA  
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

### Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free softwareâ€”to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

### 0. Applicability
This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law.

Activities other than copying, distribution, and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).

### 1. Copying and Distribution
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you:

- Conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty.
- Keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty.
- Give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

### 2. Modifying the Program
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

- **(a)** You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
- **(b)** You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
- **(c)** If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty.

### 3. Object Code Distribution
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

- **(a)** Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code.
- **(b)** Accompany it with a written offer to provide a copy of the source code for no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution.

### 4. Sublicensing
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.

### 5. Acceptance
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.

## NO WARRANTY

Because the Program is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty for the Program, to the extent permitted by applicable law. The copyright holders provide the Program "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied.

In no event will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and/or redistribute the Program, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Program.

## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

```plaintext
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify

(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
